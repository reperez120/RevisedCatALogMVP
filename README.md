Summary: The Cat-A-Log app uses  APIs, the Cat API and the PetFinder API, to display a list of cats with selected traits that are up for adoption in a specified area. The user selects desired traits in checkboxes and then inputs the desired zipcode into an input box. Once the user clicks the form’s submit button, an event listener is triggered that fetches the Cat API, which contains a list of cat breeds and their characteristics, and returns an array of breeds that have the traits the user selected in the checkbox. The app next fetches the PetFinder API, which contains a list of pets up for adoption, and uses the breeds that were returned from the Cat API and the geographic area the user input as query parameters to return a list of cats with desired traits up for adoption in the user’s geographic area. The app then displays the returned array of  cats’ names, photos, descriptions, and links to their adoption pages.
